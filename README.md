# PaperBlastBatch
The "paperblastbatch.py" file is a short python script that iteratively runs multiple
inputs into the PaperBlast webserver (https://papers.genomics.lbl.gov/cgi-bin/litSearch.cgi)

The input can be a fasta file, but the script can be modified to input a list of 
protein accession numbers such as WP_071359756.1
